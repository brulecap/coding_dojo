<!--This is a mess. I did not make enough blocks and as a result I ended up with to many classes and ids.
	It could use a major overhaul, but I think my time is better spent moving forward. I learned my lesson with this one! If I have time I will come back and rework.-->

				<p>Computers connected to the <span class="turquoise">Web</span> are called <span class="bold">clients</span> and <span class="bold">servers</span>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="turquoise">Clients</span> are the typical Web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to you Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to you mobile network) and <span class="turquoise">Web-accessing software</span> available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
					<li><span class="turquoise">Servers</span> are computers that store <span class="turquoise">webpages</span>, <span class="turquoise">sites</span>, or <span class="turquoise">apps</span>. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a cop of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><span class="blue">So What Actually Happens?</span></h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The browser goes to the <span class="turquoise">DNS Server</span> and finds the real address of the <span class="turquoise">server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
					<li>The browser sends an <span class="turquoise">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
					<li>If the server approves the client's request, the server rsend the client a <span class="turquoise">"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chuncks.</li>
					<li>THe browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>
