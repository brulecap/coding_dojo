				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="variable_declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers. <code>var x;</code></li>
					<li><a href="variable_assignment">Variable Assignment</a>  Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <code>var x = 10;</code></li>
					<li><a href="conditionals">Conditionals</a>  When you write code, you want to perfom different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your coded to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <code>if</code> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <code>else if</code> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <code>else</code> we execute this block of code</li>
					<li><a href="loops">Loops</a>  There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all do essentially the same thing: they will repeat an action soe number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four time and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
					<li><a href="functions">Functions</a>  Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an exmple imagine we are puttin together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
